# Multiclipboard
Multiclipboard is a program for having multiple hotkeys for the copy-paste function and thus, having multiple clipboards, each with its own hotkey. 
This app offers you to copy multiple texts in a different locations by pressing ctrl+c+<key> , to store your value in that specific key. It also offers an option to add your own hotkey(eg. ctrl+m) for either copying or pasting. It shows the copied data with respect to the key and the current hotkeys for copying and pasting.
A help button is provided for any further help.

  This app opens on start up. the following instructions will help you use the app:
  
  How to run:
  
  1)Download the .zip file and extract it
  
  2)Run the multiclipboard_install.sh file (double click on it)
  
  3)Reboot the computer to make sure that the app opens on startup
  
  How to use:
  
  1)Enter hotkey for copy and that for paste(default is ctrl+c and ctrl+v respectively).
  This will be the keys you will have to press in order to copy and paste.
  Leave this space empty for using the default hotkeys.
  
  2)Click on 'activate clipboard' to activate the clipboard.
  
  3)To copy or paste hold <command>+<key>,where <command> is the value you entered for the hotkey and <key> is any alphabet or number(DO NOT use default hotkeys like ctrl+c+q as the system will do the default function(i.e. ctrl+q, this will quit the tab)after copying).
  eg:ctrl+c+1 will copy your data in key <1>
     ctrl+p+1 will paste this data
     (while releasing keys, release p or c first and then release<key>).
  
  NOTES:
  
  1)This app is currently functional only in linux OS
  
  2)You must log in as superuser or have root permissions to use the app
  
  3)You can still use your normal copy and paste(just ctrl+c or ctrl+v) while
  the program is running.
  
  4)DO NOT use any of the systems default hotkeys(except ctrl+c and ctrl+v) for copy and pasting hotkeys as they may cause some errors.
